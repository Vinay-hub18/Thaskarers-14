After you download the files form git,
For the customer side, run customer.cpp
- g++ customer.cpp
- ./a

If you want the worker/admin side: run Main.java
- javac Main.java
- java Main.java

Note that there is only one admin, and he is fixed with the following details:
Admin user id: Admin
Password: admin123

As a worker though, you can freely sign up as a new user too.

- Customer.txt and service.txt will automatically be created, even if they are not present at the time of running. 
- Admin.txt should definitely be present at the time of running as it is fixed

When you are logged in as admin, if there is a scheduling request that needs to be assigned, the code will show you eligible workers based on :
- Locality
- Preferred Gender
- Worker contains at least one requested work
Now, you should manually check whether the workers don't have any booked services during the requested time, and assign them.
